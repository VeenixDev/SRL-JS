# SRL - Standard RegExp Language

This is a simple language which compiles into a "Regular Expression". The language is inspired by the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lightbulb/comments/mnndfc/structured_regex_language/) of [u/johnngnky](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnngnky/) on Reddit.

I don't follow the post from him but the way I created the syntax is inspired by his post and I got the idea to make this from him.

The project is in an very early state and is not mend to be used in an actual application.
